# A contour plot is a 2D way of showing a 3D surface.

# Instead of drawing the whole 3D surface, it uses curved lines (contours) to connect points that have the same value of Z (like height).

# ðŸ‘‰ Think of a geographical map:

# Lines on a map that show the same elevation (like 100m, 200m, 300m) â†’ those are contour lines.

# Closer lines = steeper slope, farther lines = gentle slope.

# Algorithm Steps

# Put the start node in the open set with priority f = g + h.

# While open set is not empty:

# Pick the node with the smallest f.

# If this node is the goal, stop (path found).

# Otherwise, for each neighbor:

# Calculate new cost (tentative_g = g(current) + edge_cost).

# If this path is better, update:

# came_from (to reconstruct path later).

# g_score[neighbor].

# f_score = g + h.

# Add neighbor to open set.

# Repeat until goal is reached or no nodes l
