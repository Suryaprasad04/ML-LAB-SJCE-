# ðŸŒ„ Hill Climbing Algorithm (Concept)

# A simple optimization algorithm.

# Steps:

# Start with a random/initial solution.

# Look at "neighbor" solutions (small changes).

# Move to the neighbor if it improves the result.

# Repeat until no better solution is found (local maximum/minimum).

# ðŸ‘‰ In your case:

# Searching along a curve f(x) = - (x-3)Â² + 9.

# Algorithm starts at x=0, keeps moving right, stops when it reaches the peak near x=3.
